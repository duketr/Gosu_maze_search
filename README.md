# Gosu_maze_search
Introduction to Programming project at Swinburne University

This project utilizes the 2D game development Gosu library for Ruby. The user is prompted with a window with green background after running the program. Clicking on the background changes it color from green to yellow. After changing the desired blocks, the user can continue to right-click on the yellow path. The programme will then highlight the shortest path to go from left to right in the color red.
